#You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
#On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
#Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
#prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(prices):
        summ=0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1):
            if prices[i+1]>prices[i]:
                #summ = summ + prices[i+1]-prices[i]
                summ += prices[i+1]-prices[i]
        prices=summ
        return prices
